## Belly Button Biodiversity
### Summary of the project
In this project, we are creating an interactive dashboard to explore the navel biodiversity dataset, which lists the microbes that colonize the human navel.
The data set shows that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
We are making three different charts:
- Bar chart
- Bubble chart
- Gauge chart
